      alt: water
    description: Langevin simulation of active matter system. Code is written in Python 3.0 and can be found <a href="https://github.com/kizzhang/langevinSimulation">here</a>. I will add README file later.
  - title: Simple Cell Counting Program
    image:

      alt: water
    description: I wrote some simple <a href="https://github.com/kizzhang/codeforHS2Bproject">MATLAB scripts</a> to measure cells captured under bright-field/phase-contrast microscope. I will update README file once paper is out.
